### UnifiedMap roadmap & "old" maps deprecation notice
c:geo has an all-new map implementation called "UnifiedMap" since some time, which will ultimately replace the old implementations of Google Maps and Mapsforge (OpenStreetMap). This is a deprecation notice to inform you about the further roadmap.

UnifiedMap got published about a year ago. It still supports Google Maps and OpenStreetMap (online + offline), but in a completely reworked technical way, and with a lot of exciting new features that the "old" maps do not support, some of which are
- Map rotation for OpenStreetMap based maps (online + offline)
- Cluster popup for Google Maps
- Hide map sources you don't need
- Elevation chart for routes and tracks
- Switch between lists directly from map
- "Driving mode" for OpenStreetMap based maps

UnfiedMap has proven to be stable since quite some time, thus we will remove the old map implementations to reduce the efforts for maintaining c:geo.

Roadmap:
- "Old" maps are in deprecation mode now - we won't fix bugs for it anymore.
- UnifiedMap will be made default for all users in fall of 2025.
- "Old" map implementations will be removed in spring 2026.

Until then, you can switch between the different implementations in settings => map sources.
