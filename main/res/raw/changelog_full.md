- This is work in progress, stay tuned!
- The old filter systems are still available (for the time being), but will be superseeded by the new system at some point in time.

### Rework of theming
- Change: We've completely reworked the internal technical aspects c:geo theming
- This has been done for several reasons:
  - Main reason is a technical cleanup, to free c:geo from the burden of some outdated and no longer supported components.
  - By this we have the base (and already introduce some) more modern UI components provided by Android.
  - And last but not least we hope to give c:geo a more modern and fresh look and a better usability ;-)
- This will probably have a couple of side-effects, some of them unintended. Please report any errors or glitches either on our [GitHub page](https://www.github.com/cgeo/cgeo/issues) or by contacting support.
