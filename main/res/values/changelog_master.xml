<h1>Nightly build:</h1>
<h4>Android 11 notice:</h4>
Android 11 enforces a new way for storing data, which c:geo does not support yet. If you switch your system to Android 11, c:geo will not be able to access part of its data. This will most likely disable storing offline maps, importing/exporting data as well as backing up/restoring c:geo\'s database. Other effects may occur. We recommend to not upgrade to Android 11 for the time being.

<h4>Map:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Show list markers also on waypoints</li>
</ul>
