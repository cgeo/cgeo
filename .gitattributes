# For translated strings we do not want automatic merging between branches as Crowdin will deliver translations to each branch as needed
# Including these files when merging branches would often result in conflicts as we receive regular changes on both branches from Crowdin
# The merge strategy ours is a dummy merge strategy only returning "true" as defined in .gitconfig for this repository.
# This will result in the files mentioned here not being processed during merge
