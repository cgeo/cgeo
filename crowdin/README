INSTALLATION

- create a NEW local repo from the github repo
  -> the scripts automatically run git pull, git push, git commit
  -> DON'T DO ANY WORK ON THIS REPO!! It will be pushed automatically!
  -> this repo can be a copy (cp -a) from an existing one
- copy crowdin/credentials.template to crowdin/credentials
- edit crowdin/credentials
  -> find the API-KEY here http://crowdin.net/project/cgeo/settings#project-settings-api
- prepare crowdin:
  - run update manually
  - upload language files to crowdin (values-*/strings.xml) via upload script. 
    Maybe it is best to start with one language or two and upload more later.
- create a cronjob to run crowdin/download every 60 mins or trigger it somehow
- create a cronjob to run crowdin/update every 60 mins or trigger it somehow

THE SCRIPTS

Run all scripts from within a repo.

- update: no arguments
  -> this will upload the base language file values/strings.xml to crowdin

- download: no arguments
  -> this will download the language files from crowdin and create/update a 
     pull request if necessary

- upload: languages as arguments. e.g. upload cs da de es fr hu it ja nb nl pl pt sk sl sv
  -> this will upload translations from actual branch of the repo to crowdin.
     crowdin files will be overwritten, not merged. To merge it is best to 
     download them first, merge, then upload.
